<div>
    Allows to disable the check for missing upstream build info.
    <p>
        Upstream build info may be missing in several cases 
        (e.g. build has been deleted by log rotation handlers).
        In such case the plugin won&#39;t be able to extract the data from the upstream build.
    </p>
    <p>
        The enabled control will prevent false-failures, but the security may be violated.
        Use the control <b style="color:red">on your own risk</b>
    </p>
